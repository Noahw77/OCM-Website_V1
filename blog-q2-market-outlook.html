    <h1>Q2 Market Outlook</h1>
    <p><em>Published: July 1, 2025</em></p>
    <article>
      <p>As global macro trends evolve, Ochoco Capital has shifted its allocation strategy
         to overweight large-cap value while trimming speculative tech. Key inflation data
         and central bank policies continue to influence tactical decisions.</p>
      <p>Our positioning reflects confidence in selective growth and structured risk while
         watching geopolitical volatility and currency headwinds. Fixed income exposure remains
         defensive.</p>
      <p>This outlook guides both near-term adjustments and long-term portfolio themes aligned with
         our core philosophy of asymmetric opportunity and risk control.</p>
