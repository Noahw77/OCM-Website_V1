      <h2>Growth Equity</h2>
      <p>We invest in great businesses with strong growth and compelling valuations, as well as unique special situations. With a 3–5 year time horizon and a concentrated portfolio, we seek scalable opportunities in U.S.-listed equities across technology, media, and consumer sectors. Our process focuses on sustainable earnings growth and attractive entry points supported by a long-term investment thesis.</p>

      <h2>Sector Innovation</h2>
      <p>Our philosophy centers on identifying superior businesses—those with large addressable markets, market leadership, high returns on capital, capable management, reinvestment opportunities, and financial strength. We aim to own companies that can double earnings within 3–5 years and whose valuations underestimate future earnings power.</p>

      <h2>Global Expansion</h2>
      <p>We pursue opportunities where our research identifies underappreciated upside. Using data screening tools and proprietary models, we evaluate financial strength, growth potential, and valuation to inform our investment decisions. Our framework emphasizes clarity of thesis, resilience to macro shocks, and continuous evaluation based on fundamentals and market structure.</p>
